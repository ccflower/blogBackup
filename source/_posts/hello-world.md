A First Level Header
====================
A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.
### Header 3

- Candy.
- Gum.
- Booze.

* A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.
    Another paragraph.

    The third paragraph.

* Another item in the list.

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

    <blockquote>
    <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>
